Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you do this with me, either at the same time, or (perhaps better) right afterwards. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "**Question:** How are microRNAs produced in the cell, and what is the function of the proteins involved?\n",
       "\n",
       "**Answer:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are produced through a well-defined biogenesis pathway in cells. They originate from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The first step involves the Drosha/DGCR complex, which precisely cuts the pri-miRNAs into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) that have a stem-loop (hairpin) structure. The pre-miRNAs are then transported from the nucleus to the cytosol via the Exportin-5/RAN-GTP complex. \n",
       "\n",
       "Once in the cytosol, the Dicer/TRBP complex processes the pre-miRNAs by further editing them to form mature miRNA duplexes, removing the loop structure. The mature miRNAs are incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Within this complex, Argonaute proteins (specifically Ago2 in humans) play a vital role in guiding the mature miRNA strand to bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The seed sequence of the miRNA (the first 2–8 nucleotides of its 5' end) facilitates this interaction, influencing gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. This processing and targeting mechanism underscores the importance of the proteins involved, which ensure the accurate and effective function of miRNAs in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homoeostasis."
